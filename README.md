Abstract
Background: The periconceptional period is a critical window for the origins of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, yet little is known about the dietary patterns that promote perinatal health.

Objective: We used machine learning methods to determine the effect of periconceptional dietary patterns on risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, and a composite of these outcomes.

Methods: We used data from 8259 participants in the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (8 US medical centers, 2010â€’2013). Usual daily periconceptional intake of 82 food groups was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire. We used k-means clustering with a Euclidean distance metric to identify dietary patterns. We estimated the effect of dietary patterns on each perinatal outcome using targeted maximum likelihood estimation and an ensemble of machine learning algorithms, adjusting for confounders including health behaviors and psychological, neighborhood, and sociodemographic factors.

Results: The 4 dietary patterns that emerged from our data were identified as "Sandwiches and snacks" (34% of the sample); "High fat, sugar, and sodium" (29%); "Beverages, refined grains, and mixed dishes" (21%); and "High fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and plant proteins" (16%). One-quarter of pregnancies had preeclampsia (8% incidence), gestational diabetes (5%), preterm birth (8%), or SGA birth (8%). Compared with the "High fat, sugar, and sodium" pattern, there were 3.3 to 4.3 fewer cases of the composite adverse outcome per 100 pregnancies among participants following the "Beverages, refined grains and mixed dishes" pattern (risk difference -0.043; 95% confidence interval -0.078, -0.009), "High fruits, vegetables, whole grains and plant proteins" pattern (-0.041; 95% confidence interval -0.078, -0.004), and "Sandwiches and snacks" pattern (-0.033; 95% confidence interval -0.065, -0.002).

Conclusions: Our results highlight that there are a variety of periconceptional dietary patterns that are associated with perinatal health and reinforce the negative health implications of diets high in fat, sugars, and sodium.
